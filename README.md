### Description

Just a trick to share I hit by accident one day on making backgrounds visible with the use of CLEAR BACKGROUND GIF files, I use MS-Gif-Animator to make the outer edges of each birds "frame" transparent instead of the black/white of each overwriting each other that other sprite coders are doing for animations, each is just a gif with a clear background get it?, thus 1 image vs. 2 of each image, each image is either visible or not via the timer and the "a=a+1 variable" (it just activates the NEXT FRAME button and (also a great option for checking what the image looks like in movement if you disable the timer and make it visible again), Someone give me a dang globe?, hahahaha, Enjoy
